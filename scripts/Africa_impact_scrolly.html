            Low income countries will bear the brunt of the impact of climate change.
            The majority of these countries are both highly vulnerable its impacts
            and unprepared to improve resilience.

            African countries are particularly susceptible to climate change. The world’s 10 most climate vulnerable
            countries are in Africa, accounting for 20% of the continent’s population. Most African countries are also
            unprepared to tackle the impacts of climate change.

            Yet Rich, industrialised countries are largely responsible for climate change,
            having emitted most of the greenhouse gases causing rising global temperatures.

            Africa has contributed the least to climate change through emissions.
            Africa accounts for less than 4% of global fossil fuel emissions,
            despite accounting for nearly 17% of the world's population.
