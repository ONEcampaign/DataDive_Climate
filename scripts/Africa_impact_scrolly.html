            Millions of livestock have died across the Horn of Africa this year,
            where over 15 million people face severe water shortages, food insecurity and historic drought.
            <br><br>
            It is the African continent’s 152nd drought since 2000

            Low income countries will bear the brunt of the impact of climate change.
            The majority of these countries are both highly vulnerable its impacts
            and unprepared to improve resilience.

            <a href="#story/1603948/slide-2"></a></p>

        <p>
            African countries are particularly susceptible to climate change. The world’s 10 most climate vulnerable
            countries are in Africa, accounting for 20% of the continent’s population. Most African countries are also
            unprepared to tackle the impacts of climate change.

            <a href="#story/1603948/slide-3"></a></p>

        <p>
            Climate vulnerable countries are also amongst those most impacted by the pandemic,
            rising food costs, and conflict. This convergence of crises places these countries
            in a particularly precarious situation.
            The adverse effects of climate change aggravate their development challenges,
            put additional strain on their already overstretched finances, and raise the risk
            of increased conflict and displaced populations.
            <br>
            This situation has only worsened in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian
            invasion of Ukraine. 23 African countries are already in or at high risk of debt distress,
            which risks handcuffing their ability to take climate action.

        <p>
            Yet Rich, industrialised countries are largely responsible for climate change,
            having emitted most of the greenhouse gases causing rising global temperatures.

        </p>

        <p>
            Africa has contributed the least to climate change through emissions.
            Africa accounts for less than 4% of global fossil fuel emissions,
            despite accounting for nearly 17% of the world's population.
