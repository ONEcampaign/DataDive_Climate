        Many African countries have large reserves of minerals and metals
        critical for clean energy technologies. These hold significant
        revenue potential given that global demand for them is set to increase
        exponentially in the coming decades. They also provide an opportunity for
        African countries to invest in added-value manufacturing processes.

            Zimbabwe produces a small amount of lithium, a key mineral used in
            electric vehicle batteries, but several other countries are
            believed to have extensive untapped deposits.

            The DRC accounts for two-thirds of global production of cobalt,
            a mineral used in electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries,
            and carbon capture installations. It is a common byproduct of copper,
            which is a cornerstone for all electricity-related technologies,
            including electric vehicles and batteries, solar panels, and wind turbines.

            South Africa accounts for 45% of the world’s production of chromium,
            used to produce wind turbines and for carbon capture. Zimbabwe is the
            world’s fifth largest producer. The two countries also account for
            three-fourths of the world’s platinum, which is used in green hydrogen production.

            Guinea is the world’s largest producer of bauxite (23%),
            the chief source of aluminium, which is used in solar panels,
            lithium batteries, and carbon capture installations.

        <p>
            Africa accounts for half of the global production of manganese,
            which is used in electric vehicle automobile and battery production,
            solar, wind turbines, and carbon storage.
